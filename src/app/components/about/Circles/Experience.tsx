        <p>With my four years' experience in digital marketing, I learnt to perfect project management and meet either the company's or clients' deadlines. I ran multi-million euro (annual) budgets for clients such as Easyjet, to overseeing far smaller expenditures from various Berlin startups. </p>
        <p>The Fullstack Developer Bootcamp I completed in 2023 allowed me to accelerate my coding experience, with either solo or group projects. I routinely worked in a team, mostly for weekly projects but also for one-day Hackathons
